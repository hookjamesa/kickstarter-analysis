# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise, our client, wants to evaluate her fundraising for her play Fever. Using data available at this time, the following analysis shows her success rate compared to those who started in the same timeframe and approximate fundraising needs.

## Analysis and Challenges

This analysis compares outcomes of fundraising efforts for theatrical efforts (plays, musicals, and spaces) based on time of year. It also looks at plays specifically with regards to monetary goals. While available, this analysis did not look at outcome results from Kickstarter staff picks and spotlights, as preferences and algorithms are not well understood from the data set. Additional challenges come from localized cultural expectations and valuation of currency, which could not be adjusted for these challenges.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Launch dates have some effect on outcome. Based on available information, May and June have the largest number of successful theatrical efforts. These months also have the highest success rate. However, underlying reasons for success cannot be determined from available data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Lower cost projects appear to have a higher success rate, with projects under 1,000 valuation in local currency having the best results at 75%. Projects under 5,000 in local currency also have a high success rate at 72%, with mixed results for other projects in excess of 5,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The data does not account for local cultural expectations and valuation of money. While the data could be adjusted for cultural differences, it is outside the scope of this analysis. One other difficulty is the age of the available data. Projects after 2017 were not able to be considered.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

May and June are the most likely to have positive outcomes for theater fundraising projects. December is unlikely to have a positive outcome for theater fundraising projects.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Low cost projects under 5000 of localized currency are the most likely to succeed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The data is highly represented on lower cost projects, and it does not have clarity on play genres to understand what is popular in any given year. Additionally, data ends in 2017, which may not be relevant to modern interests and forces extrapolation to modern theater sensibilities. It also does not connect currencies, leading to some deviation in our goal cost analysis.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

This analysis would be further bolstered in evaluating how the fundraiser was promoted on Kickstarter by staff and spotlight, as well as graphing a continuous timeline of successful projects. We could also break down outcomes by dates for plays alone, instead of overall theater category projects.
